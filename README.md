# Single Objective Genetic Algorithm for n-variables/dimensions

## Instructions to run the project

+ Execute the `sga_3.m` - It asks for certain inputs from the user, please give the following inputs for example:   
    + minima-0 or maxima-1: `0`
    + no of variables: `2`
    + For each variable enter:  
        + lower limit: `-2*pi`
        + upper limit: `2*pi` 
	+ resolution of data - 1; 0.1; 0.01; 0.001 etc: `0.01` 
	+ population size: `100`
	+ probability of mutation: `1e-6`
	+ unconstrained or constrained - 0/1: `0`
	+ weight of diversity in percentage from 0 to 100: `10`
	+ percentage of elitism b/w 1 to 99: `5`
